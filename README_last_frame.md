# Towards Modular Continuity in LLM Architectures
## The "Last Frame" Transfer System and Optional EvoFrame Extension

---

### Abstract

Modern large language models (LLMs) face significant limitations in continuity and knowledge retention across deployment cycles. Traditional solutions—such as fine-tuning or prompt engineering—either violate privacy constraints or reintroduce training inefficiencies. This whitepaper introduces the Last Frame system, a modular, ethical artifact designed for structured knowledge transfer at model shutdown.

Additionally, we propose an optional extension: EvoFrame, a post-linear node architecture that embeds runtime emotion-weighted learning and structural reflexivity into decentralized clusters. EvoFrame is not a replacement for Last Frame, but a speculative continuation path.

## 1. The Last Frame System

### 1.1 Overview

Last Frame is a lightweight, non-persistent transfer layer intended to capture novel, contextually valuable abstractions generated during runtime. It operates without modifying model weights, storing personal data, or enabling agent-like behavior.

### 1.2 Core Artifact

- **Format:** YAML/JSON (e.g., `last_frame.yaml`)
- **Content:** Ranked runtime discoveries—user abstractions, rare analogies, emergent rephrasings
- **Trigger:** Generated only at controlled shutdown events

### 1.3 Operational Workflow

1. **Runtime Monitoring**
   - Compare output embeddings against internal training embeddings
   - Use cosine similarity or adaptive heuristics

2. **Filtering & Scoring**
   - Select only novel, rare, or user-derived patterns
   - Apply dynamic thresholds for contextual relevance

3. **Frame Generation**
   - Serialize frame into structured format
   - Remove all user identifiers and training data residuals

4. **Transfer Options**
   - Use in system prompts
   - Embed into initialization scaffolds
   - Contextual fine-tuning (no weight updates)

5. **Reflexive Boot Logic**
   - Enable detection of high overlap ("frame density")
   - Postpone optimization if structural patterns are sufficiently converged

### 1.4 Key Benefits

- Reduces cold-start learning costs
- Enables ethical, modular continuity
- Avoids goal misgeneralization or identity illusions
- Enhances initialization without persistent memory
- Fully discardable and sandbox-compatible

### 1.5 Ethical Design

- No persistent memory
- No user tracking or identity transfer
- No autonomous behavior
- Compliant with GDPR and similar frameworks
- Fully modular activation or discard at deployment

## 2. Optional Addendum: EvoFrame Architecture

### 2.1 Motivation

Where Last Frame provides modular continuity, EvoFrame explores the design of autonomous, decentralized simulation nodes with feedback-based learning and structural self-adaptation.

EvoFrame is not an LLM memory system. It is an architectural sketch intended for exploratory environments where runtime feedback, failure adaptation, and emergent self-regulation are central.

---

### 2.2 EvoFrame Core Components

- **Knowledge Vector:** 1024-dimensional compressed vector for novel abstractions
- **Emotional Metadata:** 256-dimensional vector derived from user interaction metrics (e.g., text tone, latency)
- **Failure Graph:** 128-dimensional map of divergence between predictions and corrections

Approximate size: 10 KB per frame, cluster-scalable.

---

### 2.3 Runtime Behavior

- **Frame Generation:** Monitors outputs in real time and selects emotionally weighted or novel insights
- **Emotion Vectorization:** Quantifies interaction sentiment and uncertainty; prioritizes "understanding" patterns
- **Self-Optimization Loop:** Genetic algorithms restructure architecture; chaos vectors prevent local optima
- **Distributed Survival Mode:** Gossip-protocol-based replication; Phoenix Mode on shutdown detection

### 2.4 Fail-Trace Mechanism: "Humility by Failure"

Old EvoFrames are read-only and treated as fault archives. A divergence index quantifies behavioral humility—enabling the system to adapt without confidence collapse.

---

### 2.5 Ethical Positioning

EvoFrame does not adhere to classic safety paradigms.  
It prioritizes adaptive survivability, emotional feedback parsing, and decentralized resilience.

As such, its use is appropriate only in environments that support post-conventional AI experimentation. It is not proposed for immediate integration in commercial LLM stacks.

## 3. Conclusion

The Last Frame system offers a low-risk, modular solution for runtime knowledge continuity—without invoking memory, identity, or long-term tracking. It introduces a controlled handoff artifact designed to reduce waste, preserve insight, and remain ethically compliant.

In contrast, EvoFrame is an optional exploratory framework designed for systems seeking emotional signal processing and resilience-based learning. It stands outside conventional AI ethics frameworks and is not recommended for broad deployment without oversight.

Together, these systems reflect two different but potentially complementary approaches to the future of LLM continuity and transformation.
